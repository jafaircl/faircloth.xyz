Gatsby is a fantastic static site generator for React. In fact, this website is built using it. The great thing about static site generators is that they output static HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. This makes them incredibly fast and SEO friendly. For this reason, they are becoming the tool of choice for developers looking to give their users a great experience and help their content get discovered. One way to increase this exposure is to take advantage of the [Accelerated Mobile Pages Project](https://www.ampproject.org/) from Google.

With its server-side rendering APIs and React features, Gatsby provides a unique ability to create AMP pages from existing content without sacrificing user experience. So, I created [`gatsby-plugin-amp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-plugin-amp). The goal of this plugin should make deploying valid AMP verions of your pages as easy as possible.
